Burnito is a firmware for the Shruthi-1 digital board with a very specific
purpose: burn I2C eeproms with Shruthi-1 presets.

This firmware contains a large 16kb blob in flash with the eeprom contents. At
boot, it tries to recognize the size of the eeprom, and writes the relevant
part of this blob to the eeprom. Afterwards, the data is read back from the
eeprom and compared to the original.
